Today, we'll lay the groundwork for our journey into efficient data organization and problem-solving.\n\n**What are Data Structures?** Think of them as specialized containers for organizing and storing data. The choice of data structure dramatically impacts how efficiently we can access, modify, and process information. We'll explore fundamental structures like **arrays** and **linked lists**, understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and common use cases.\n\n**What is Algorithmic Thinking?** This is the art of breaking down complex problems into a series of well-defined steps, or algorithms. We'll focus on developing your ability to design, analyze, and implement these step-by-step solutions.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Abstract Data Types (ADTs):** A conceptual blueprint for data structures, focusing on operations rather than implementation details.\n*   **Time and Space Complexity (Big O Notation):** We'll introduce the crucial concept of analyzing algorithm efficiency. How much time (time complexity) and memory (space complexity) does an algorithm consume as the input size grows?\n\n**Practical Example: Array vs. Linked List Insertion**\n\nImagine you have a list of items and need to insert a new item at the beginning.\n\n*   **Array:** Inserting at the beginning requires shifting all existing elements one position to the right. This can be slow for large arrays.\n*   **Linked List:** Inserting at the beginning is incredibly efficient. You just create a new node and point it to the original head.\n\n**Code Snippet (Conceptual Python):**\n\n```python\n# Illustrative, not a full implementation\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next = None\n\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n\n    def insert_at_beginning(self, new_data):\n        new_node = Node(new_data)\n        new_node.next = self.head\n        self.head = new_node\n\n# Example Usage:\nmy_list = LinkedList()\nmy_list.insert_at_beginning(10)\nmy_list.insert_at_beginning(5)\n# Now, 5 is at the head.\n```\n\nToday is about building intuition and understanding the \"why\" behind choosing specific data structures and designing efficient algorithms.

Using the ADK's auto-schema generation via docstrings simplified this significantly compared to writing raw JSON schemas.\n* **Event Handling:** The ADK returns complex event streams (FunctionCall -> FunctionResponse -> ModelResponse). My initial implementation failed when trying to parse tool events as text. I resolved this by implementing a robust extractor function that specifically hunts for text parts in the event history.\n\n### Future Improvements\nTo make this production-ready, I would:\n1.  Replace the mock dictionary tool with a real vector database search (RAG) for curriculum retrieval.\n2.  Implement a \"Human-in-the-loop\" checkpoint before the Content Agent runs, allowing the user to approve the syllabus.","metadata":{}}]}
